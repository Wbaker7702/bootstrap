## Reporting a vulnerability

Use one of these private channels (do not open a public issue):

- GitHub Security Advisories: use the “Report a vulnerability” option on this repository’s Security tab.
- Email: `security@getbootstrap.com` (include "SECURITY" in the subject).

See the full policy in our [SECURITY policy]([[config:repo]]/blob/v[[config:current_version]]/SECURITY.md) for triage timelines, coordinated disclosure, and scope details.

## Security advisories

We publish advisories via GitHub Security Advisories and via our release notes when applicable.

- [Advisories]([[config:repo]]/security/advisories)
- [Releases]([[config:repo]]/releases)

## Supported versions for security fixes

Security fixes are generally provided for the latest minor of the most recent major version. Older versions may receive fixes at maintainers’ discretion when effort and risk are low.

Refer to `SECURITY.md` in the repository for the canonical policy.
