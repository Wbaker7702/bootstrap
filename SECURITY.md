# Security Policy

We take the security of Bootstrap and our users seriously. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to validate, remediate, and publicly disclose issues in a coordinated manner.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use one of the following private channels (do not open a public issue):

- GitHub Security Advisories: use the "Report a vulnerability" option on this repository’s Security tab.
- Email: `security@getbootstrap.com` (include "SECURITY" in the subject line).

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible so we can reproduce and assess impact:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- A minimal proof-of-concept or reproduction steps
- Affected versions/commits and environment details
- Any known mitigations or workarounds

Preferred language is English. Encryption is not required; if you need to share sensitive details, mention this and we can arrange an encrypted channel.

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgement of receipt within 2 business days
- Initial triage and severity assessment within 5 business days
- Ongoing coordination on fix timelines, testing, and disclosure plans

We’ll keep you informed of progress and may ask for additional information to reproduce or validate the issue.

### Coordinated Disclosure

- We request that you keep vulnerability details confidential until a fix is released.
- We will prepare a security release and publish release notes and/or an advisory describing impact and mitigation.
- We will credit reporters who wish to be acknowledged; please include the name/handle you’d like us to use.

### Scope

This policy covers code and assets maintained in this repository. It does not cover third‑party services, dependencies, or infrastructure not controlled by this project (e.g., hosting providers, external CDNs, or external websites).

### Out of Scope/Prohibited Testing

- Denial of service or resource exhaustion
- Automated scans that degrade service for others
- Social engineering, phishing, or physical security attacks
- Vulnerabilities requiring a compromised device/account or rooted/jailbroken environment
- Clickjacking on pages without sensitive state‑changing actions
- Best‑practice recommendations without a concrete, actionable vulnerability

If you are unsure whether something is in scope, contact us first using the channels above.

### Safe Harbor

We will not pursue civil or criminal action, nor will we initiate a law‑enforcement investigation against you for security research performed in good faith under this policy. Testing must:

- Avoid privacy violations and data exfiltration
- Avoid service degradation or disruption
- Use test accounts where possible and only access your own data
- Cease testing and notify us immediately upon discovering a risk of harm

### Bounties

We do not operate a monetary bug bounty program. While we cannot offer rewards, we value and publicly acknowledge security contributions (with reporter consent).

### Supported Versions for Security Fixes

Security fixes are generally released for the latest minor of the most recent major version. Older versions may receive fixes at the maintainers’ discretion when the effort and risk are low.
